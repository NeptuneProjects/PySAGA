# PySAGA

This is a Python wrapper for interacting with [SAGA 5.5](https://github.com/NoiseLabUCSD/saga5.5), a geoacoustic inversion software package. SAGA was written in FORTRAN by [Peter Gerstoft](http://noiselab.ucsd.edu) and has an existing MATLAB wrapper. The aim of this package is to replicate the MATLAB wrapper.
